covid data set about deaths-->
we use 
location, date ,total_cases, 
new_cases,total_deaths,population.
 
2)-->looking for total cases vs total deaths-->
Formula--> Total cases/Total deaths *100
for 'x' cases and 'Y' deaths we will get 'z' percentage of death.

3)-->looking for countires having highest infection 
rate compared poupulation.
--we use MAX for highest infection rate and group by as per 
location and population

4)--> looking for countries with highest death count per 
population.
--we use MAX on total_deaths and aslo cast it in big int 
for accuratue data and add where clause for showing not 
NULL records.

5) break the above calculated datas basis on continent

6) breaking down to global numbers
we need to use aggragate function.SUM
it will not filter as per continent or location rather it will 
filter on basis of date and give out total number of deaths 
for that give date/per day.

----JOIN THE DEATH AND VACCINATION TABLES----
7) we have to look for total population vs total vaccination
8) we gonna work on new vaccination records where each 
one adds up to total number.we use partition by and windows
function.
9)--> we use cte/temp table for creation of percentage table for 
people vaccinated.
10)-->we create a view now-->for storing data for visualization
